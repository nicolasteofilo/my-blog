        I'm a software developer, I currently work as a back-end developer, I
        work mainly with the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, however I have
        also worked as a front-end developer, also with the same programming
        language that I use in the backend.

        I'm always looking for innovations and continuous learning, always
        aiming to offer a higher quality and great experience in all the
        software I develop.
